### Functions Exercise:

1.  Write a function called logIn that takes your name as a parameter and console.logs 'Hello ~your name!~' when it is called
2.  Take that function up a notch by creating a new variable called isLoggedIn, that logs 'Hello ~your name~' when it is true, or "please log in" when it is false
3.  Write a function that prints every number between 10 and 20
4.  Redoing the bathroom! Write a function that finds the areaInSqFt of a bathroom by taking 2 numbers - length and width - and multiplying them together. If tiles cost $2.15/sf, have your function print out how much it will  cost to redo a bath room with a Length of 12ft and a width of 10ft
5.  Write a function that loops over the following array of SEI students and prints out their name, and how many letters their name is

```js
const students = [
  'Alice',
  'Andrew',
  'Casey',
  'Damian',
  'Grant',
  'Howie',
  'Wade',
  'Kat',
  'Kimbrad',
  'Kiu',
  'Natasha',
  'Obi',
  'Pedro',
  'Sarah',
