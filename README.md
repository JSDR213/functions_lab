### Functions Exercise:



1. We are looking to re-sod our lawn. It has a length of 20' and a width of 30', with Sod costing $1.45/sqft. Additionally, it will cost $180 to have the work done.  Write a function that finds the area of the lawn, the price of the Sod needed, and what the total cost will be to get the lawn redone

2. Overtime Calculator: A local business pays $25/hr for the first 40 hours worked each week, and time-and-a-half for each hour worked after that. Using your conditionals and mathematic operators, create a function that tells us how much someone would make if they worked 35hrs in a week, and how much if they worked 45hrs. 


3. Century From Year: the first century goes from the year 1 to the year 99, the 19th century went from the year 1801 to 1900, and the 20th century strecthed from 1901 to the year 2000. Using our Math functions, write a function that takes a year as an argument, and logs which century it is in


4.  Write a function that loops over the following array of SEI students and prints out their name, and how many letters their name is (you can copy this array into your code, don't worry about re-writing it)

```js
const students = [
  'Alice',
  'Andrew',
  'Casey',
  'Damian',
  'Grant',
  'Howie',
  'Wade',
  'Kat',
  'Kimbrad',
  'Kiu',
  'Natasha',
  'Obi',
  'Pedro',
  'Sarah',
  'Scott',
  'Tiffany',
  'Zhe'
]
```

It should give us "Alice is 5 letters long"... and so on


5. E-Commerce Mock-up : Create an array of objects for sale in an e-commerce site. Each object should have a property of name, price, whether the item is in stock or not, and a rating of 1-5. Then create a function that will loop through this array and only log the items that are instock, with either a price lower than, and a rating higher than, two values that you pass in as arguments.
