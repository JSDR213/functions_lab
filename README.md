1.  Write a function called logIn that takes your name as a parameter and console.logs 'Hello /your name!/' when it is called

5.  Write a function that loops over the following array of SEI students and prints out their name, and how many letters their name is

```js
const students = [
  'Alice',
  'Andrew',
  'Casey',
  'Damian',
  'Grant',
  'Howie',

  'Kimbrad',
  'Kiu',
  'Natasha',
